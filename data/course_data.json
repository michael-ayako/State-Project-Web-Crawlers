This course will adapt the study of leadership and organizations to the unique obligations, functions, processes, and public values and societal outcomes that govern the decisions of the government and nonprofit sectors.Public service is the result of the work of local, state, and federal government; regional compacts or special districts; tribal governments; nonprofit organizations and social enterprises; partnerships between government and business; and international linkages (that are necessary for solving global problems likes pandemics and climate change) . The public service perspective is evident when government and civil society collectively marshal efforts to respond to human-made (9-11 Terrorist Attacks, Aurora, Colorado Theater Mass Shooting) and natural (Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy) disasters and public health emergencies (COVID-19 outbreak).  The public service sector does not shut down during times of wars, terrorist attacks, disasters, and public health emergencies and epidemics.Public service organizations are fundamentally different from profit-seeking firms. They are organized to provide socially valuable goods and services, e.g., public education, social services for the unemployed and the homeless, child protection services, crime-fighting, disaster response, natural resource and environmental protection, climate change response, homeland security, and public health emergency response.  They are, above all, governed by our democratic and rights-based traditions and culture. Accordingly, the government and the nonprofit sectors operate under greater public scrutiny and with unique public expectations for openness, transparency, honesty, accountability, public deliberation, citizen engagement, fairness and equity, and the pursuit of other public values that we deemimportant as a society.Government and many nonprofits, the most important actors in the public service sector, work hand-in-glove to deliver vital public goods and services and engage citizens and volunteers towards public ends.

They are organized to provide socially valuable goods and services (e.g., public education, socials services for the unemployed) independent of the revenues they receive from the sale of their products.  While surpluses and profits can support their social missions, not-for-profit organizations do not intend to maximize these surpluses\/profits.  Because not-for-profit organizations use scarce resources from taxpayers, donors, volunteers, and other external stakeholders, they also operate under greater public scrutiny and with unique public expectations for openness\/transparency, honesty, accountability, and fairness.  This course will explain how managers and leaders of public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and social enterprises can apply economic analysis and reasoning in the complex task of effectively providing social goods and services, taking into primary consideration the fundamentally different social and political goals, internal constraints, and external authorizing environments faced by not-for-profit organizations.  MPNA 635 will also improve the economic literacy of public and nonprofit professionals in discussing and defending their respective positions on a public policy issue or controversy.
